# poe-rgb-keyboard
This repository is a custom application for the game Path of Exile developed by Grinding Gaear Gaming.
The application syncs the in-game healthbar with a RGB keyboard without reading game data.
This is done through checking the RGB color of certain pixels on the screen where the Path of Exile orb (healthbar) is located.


**Disclaimer**: I haven't programmed in C++ before and unsure if the game developers allow this. **Use at your own risk.**

## Requirements 
The requirements to run this at the moment are sadly very strict:

- You must have a Coolermaster MasterKeys Pro L RGB keyboard.
- You must play full screen or borderless with a resolution of 1920x1080 on your main monitor.
- Only works on Windows.
- Might not work properly when you have a very high energy shield.
